[00:13.62]Frozen stairs carpet in blood red
[00:17.11]Seating goodbyes left unsaid goodbyes left unsaid
[00:21.09]Despite our promises here I am following your steps
[00:26.50]I'm following your steps
[00:27.85]
[00:28.42]Drop by drop
[00:30.19]
[00:31.57]As your unchanging reality dampen my sleeve
[00:35.34]You kissed them off
[00:37.21]
[00:38.02]Through the fibers of my handkerchief
[00:40.95]
[00:41.53]I am fire
[00:44.93]Burn those who dare to care for me
[00:47.87]
[00:48.77]And my fuel are memories fuel are memories of you
[00:52.79]They perish with the heat perish with the heat
[00:55.64]So I can move on
[00:58.71]Flower of iron
[01:02.38]Shrivelled up to hide the imposter in me
[01:06.70]Hey why did you leave why did you leave
[01:09.87]Don't let those words out of me
[01:11.50]Imposter's about to speak
[01:13.13]So I chewed on huameitang
[01:18.52]For whom the shelves hold on
[01:21.28]To the pages hold on to the pages
[01:23.88]Their pain their joy were given value as they were rated
[01:30.15]Isn't it ironic
[01:34.56]Greed is unlimited freedom is a limited resource
[01:39.54]Extra large for you means less for me
[01:42.92]There'll be less for me
[01:44.39]
[01:45.33]I banged the drums weiwu
[01:48.86]Court of hell weiwu
[01:49.91]Demanding a new trial weiwu
[01:53.63]You got the wrong head
[01:55.00]Would you take mine instead take mine instead
[01:58.32]Stop leading me on
[02:01.24]World of titan allows me to live
[02:06.79]Only in the mud down it's feet
[02:09.28]Though you're not with me you're not with me
[02:12.37]I'll never admit defeat
[02:14.11]'Cause when I thought that
[02:15.48]Every nice thing about me has become canxiang
[02:21.14]You showed me I still had an umbrella
[02:23.77]Full of love inside me
[02:25.63]
[02:26.21]Without you I could never be
[02:28.00]So sincerely thank you for everything
[02:30.93]It pains me to think
[02:32.26]
[02:33.25]That my happiness turned out to be one of those
[02:36.56]Fingers that strangled you until you couldn't breathe
[02:39.69]
[02:40.46]Not ashamed to go this way
[02:42.54]I just want to choose my fate
[02:43.92]I'm on my last white rabbit naitang
[02:47.48]
[02:48.44]I am iron
[02:51.85]In my blood it streams roots deep
[02:56.28]With bruises on my knees bruises on my knees
[02:59.53]And ribs crushed down to pieces crushed down to pieces
[03:02.72]Nothing left to hold on
[03:05.43]Actually wait
[03:08.23]I do have one regret
[03:09.73]
[03:10.43]That day before you left me
[03:15.46]You're my everything
[03:16.61]Before my thoughts began to speak
[03:18.56]I bit my lip said nothing
[03:20.63]And just sucked on maiyatang
